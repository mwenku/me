  summary:
    "I started out as a Product Owner and eventually moved into consulting, which means I’ve seen both sides of building products and helping teams ship them. That mix has made me pretty adaptable. I can keep things structured when needed, but I’m just as comfortable in fast-moving environments.\n\nI've spent most of career building automations and keeping Serverless microservices running.\n\nAt The Zig Group, Inc., I work with data scientists, analysts, and engineers to create interfaces and back-end systems that power ETL pipelines (basically, I put the “E” in ETL).\n\nBefore consulting, I was a founding engineer at a food delivery startup, where I built everything from the mobile apps to the backend infrastructure, scaling it from MVP to 10,000+ completed orders.\n\nIn a separate role I’ve helped build a distributed POS SaaS product made up of 24+ backend services and over 10 frontend apps on a Serverless stack.",
